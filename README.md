## What is this?
This is a Unity package loaded with useful code, art, and sound assets for developing your game! This project is still in development and I am definitely not the only one working on it! Feel free to add any useful things to the package!

## How to install
1. Open the Unity Editor
2. Go to `Window` > `Package Manager`
3. Press the `+` dropdown on the top left and press `Add package from git URL...`
4. Paste in the following git URL to target the upm branch: `https://github.com/texas-egads/EGaDS-Toolkit.git#upm`
5. After it finishes importing the necessary files should be under your `Packages` folder in the Unity project!
6. Use the necessary assembly references and namespaces to use the functionality of the code!
